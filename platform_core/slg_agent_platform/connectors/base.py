"""
Connector framework — one interface, two implementations (fixture / live).

A *connector* is the typed adapter to a system of record (311/CRM, knowledge
base, identity/consent, scheduling, GIS, IDP, permitting, eligibility, records,
procurement, ITSM, public-safety, public-health surveillance). Agents never call
a vendor SDK directly: they call the MCP gateway, which (after authorizing) calls
a connector method. That keeps three properties true:

  * One validated integration surface per system (the security/ATO scope is bounded).
  * Fixture mode runs the entire suite offline for demos, CI, and evals.
  * Live mode swaps in the real client behind the SAME method signatures, so no
    agent code changes between demo and production.

Add a system of record by registering a typed adapter in connectors/factory.py.
Method names here must match policy.TOOL_REGISTRY.
