"""
Auth helpers — extract verified IdP claims for the acting government user.

In production, identity is established at the edge (Cognito User Pool / Identity
Center federating the agency IdP — SAML 2.0 / OIDC) and the verified JWT claims
are forwarded to the agent. The gateway authorizes against these claims. This
module normalizes claim shapes so the gateway sees a consistent dict. No identity
is established here — that is the IdP's job; this only reads what was verified.
